I study polariton condensates, a unique type of quantum fluid that can flow without resistance at room temperature. My research aims to unlock novel functionalities to harness their potential for low-energy applications to help tackle the growing energy demands of the internet and artificial intelligence. I also seek to exploit their hybrid light-matter nature to generate and control quantum states, which can be useful for future advancements in hybrid quantum technologies.
